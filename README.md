The The results showed that the system was able to accurately predict the likelihood and severity of flooding. The system was also able to generate timely warnings, which can help to save lives and reduce property damage.
Floods are a major natural disaster that can cause widespread damage and loss of life. Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting and warning systems. This research paper presents a novel ML-based flood forecasting and warning system.
The proposed system uses a combination of different ML algorithms to predict the likelihood and severity of flooding. The algorithms are trained on historical data on rainfall, river levels, and other factors that can contribute to flooding. The system is also able to take into account real-time data, such as current rainfall and river levels.
The proposed system was evaluated using a dataset of historical flood events. The results showed that the system was able to accurately predict the likelihood and severity of flooding. The system was also able to generate timely warnings, which can help to save lives and reduce property damage.
The proposed system has the potential to be used in a variety of settings, including river basins, urban areas, and coastal regions. The system is also scalable and can be easily adapted to new locations.
The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges and limitations of the proposed system. The authors also discuss the potential for future research in this area.
